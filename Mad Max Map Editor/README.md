Unit Customization:

Edit the name of a selected unit.

Delete a selected unit from the map.

Distance Measurement:

Measure distances between two points on the map in feet.

Displays the measured distance in real-time.

Shape Creation:

Allows drawing shapes (e.g., rectangles) on the map to represent obstacles, zones, or other features.

How It Works:
Map Generation:

The map is generated with a grid overlay and a customizable background color (e.g., Dust).

The grid helps visualize distances and placement.

Adding Units:

Users can add random units (players, NPCs, vehicles, or items) by selecting a symbol and specifying the number of units.

Units are placed randomly on the map and can be moved by dragging.

Editing Units:

Users can select a unit to edit its name or delete it from the map.

Measuring Distance:

Users can click and drag to measure distances between two points on the map.

The distance is displayed in feet based on the map's scale.

Creating Shapes:

Users can draw shapes (e.g., rectangles) on the map to represent obstacles or zones.

Symbol Selection:

A separate frame allows users to choose symbols for units before placing them.
