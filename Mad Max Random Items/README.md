Generates random leveled items for my Mad Max tabletop RPG

Key Features:

Item Generation:

Generates random items based on a selected level (1 to 5).

Items are categorized into Weapons, Armor, Vehicle Parts, and Consumables.

Each item has unique attributes, such as damage, special effects, or bonuses.

Item Database:

Items are stored in a nested dictionary (items) organized by level and category.

Each item includes details like name, damage, AC bonuses, effects, and special abilities.

User Interface:

A simple GUI with buttons to generate items for levels 1 through 5.

Displays the generated item in a text box with formatted details.

Randomization:

Randomly selects a category (e.g., Weapons, Armor) and then a specific item from that category.
